Title :  ProgressPoint: Real-Time-Communication-Platform


Desciption: Progress Point is a centralised platform for teams to communicate and collaborate on software development projects in real-time. 
The platform will enable software engineers to be a part of multiple team rooms, post updates about their tasks, and collaborate on problem-solving
in real-time. The platform will enable developers to react and comment on each othersâ€™ posts and communicate. With Progress Point, we aim to improve teamwork and productivity in software
development projects. This platform will help software engineers stay aligned, work together to solve problems efficiently, and deliver high-quality software products on time.
